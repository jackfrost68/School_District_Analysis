# School_District_Analysis
In this project, I assist a data scientist to analyse data from local student districts. The analysis primarily will focus on school funding and student test scores i.e. both reading and math tests. The results will help the school board and superinteredent make better informed decisions about the school budget for the next calendar year. 

Below is a snapshot of the scores by school type
